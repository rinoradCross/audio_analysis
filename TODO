0) Recording functionalities:
    a) recording + classification    
1) Segmentation:
    a) Train for segmented data: input: (a) wav stream (b) segments with class labels. Both the classifiers and a viterbi probability set will be trained!
    b) flags2segs() enchancment (maybe smoothing or viterbi?)
2) Check wav file read warning: 
    a) is it crucial?
    b) why does it appear?
3) Finalize speakerDiarization()
    a) use LDA (semi-supervised) for better results
    b) number of clusters: 
     b1) finish with silluete
     b2) finish with arguments
4) Check features:
    a) Harmonic is disabled now (is it needed?)
    b) Chroma?
5) AUDIO REGRESSION!!! (Maybe to be trained from a list of mappings of audio files to regression values - e.g. in a spreadsheet)

1) Visualization: 
	a) semi-supervised: user gives similarities and LDA is used????
	b) finalize and documentation
2) Audio Regression (Maybe to be trained from a list of mappings of audio files to regression values - e.g. in a spreadsheet)
3) Segmentation:
    a) Train for segmented data: input: (a) wav stream (b) segments with class labels. Both the classifiers and a viterbi probability set will be trained!
    b) flags2segs() enchancment (maybe smoothing or viterbi?)
4) Finalize speakerDiarization()
    a) use LDA (semi-supervised) for better results
    b) number of clusters: 
     b1) finish with silluete
     b2) finish with arguments
